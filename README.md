# Submarine-text-adventure-

A short text adventure that takes place on a submarine. It was created in Python 3.4.2 for a school project in 2015. I thought I would share and to see how I used to program. It was mainly coded using almost exclusivly if-statements and was created in less than 2 days.
In order to play it, run "Adventure.py start", for more information check the source code.

Use code at free will, just give cred.
